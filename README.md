As a programmer
So I can find the one I want
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters


As a programmer
So I can record something I need to remember
I can create a new note


As a programmer
So I can see all the information in the note
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page


As a programmer
So I can record notes with fun little pictures
I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ðŸ”¥


As a programmer
So I can remember what I took down
I can refresh the page and still see my notes
```
